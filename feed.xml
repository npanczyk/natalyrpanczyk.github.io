I was fortunate to attend a high school with a wide range of advanced coursework, especially in STEM. Each year of high school, I observed the number of women in my math and science classes decrease. That trend only worsened in college. The feeling of isolation of a woman in STEM is one that can only be understood from experience.</p> <p>In his article titled, “Publishing our work increases your luck,” <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work">Aaron Francis writes</a> , “No matter how hard you work, it still takes a little bit of luck for something to hit. That can be discouraging, since luck feels like a force outside our control. But the good news is that we can increase our chances of encountering good luck.”</p> <p>While this may be true on an individual basis for many people, for others, it will take a greater systemic effort to increase our “luck” of female success in STEM, particularly in “hard science” fields, like CS or engineering. The premise of Francis’ article is that sharing your work is critical to building up your own success. While this hurdle can be difficult for the brave, it is debilitating for the companionless.</p> <p>More women in STEM beget more women in STEM. Diversity is critical to the success of our technical fields, yet learning how to start this positively reinforcing cycle has proven challenging on a global scale. What we do know is that promoting diversity in higher education systems is paramount to promoting it in the STEM workplace. Still, college campuses have timelessly proven themselves to alienate historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields.</p> <p><a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-022-00387-3">Palid et al. explain</a>, “The ‘chilly climate’ theory was coined almost 40 years ago… According to this theory, many students in STEM may experience discrimination in almost every aspect of college life, from interactions with faculty to administrators, due to a ‘chilly’ culture which tacitly allows discrimination and hostility towards students.”</p> <p>Retraining higher education to “warm up” to minorities in STEM has been an all but swift task. Studies like Palid et al. ‘s seek to evaluate types of STEM intervention programs (SIPs) that can specifically promote the number of women retained in these majors and in their respective industries post-graduation. The most popular parameters studied are mentorship, skillbuilding, supplemental learning, financial aid, and socializing, each playing a role in female success in a given program (Palid et al.). Consequently, initiatives that encompass many of these parameters have a higher potential for impact than any one alone.</p> <p>In other words, increasing gender diversity in STEM cannot be achieved simply by offering more scholarships to women. The scholarships must be offered in tandem with research opportunities or other supplemental learning experiences, mentorship programs (especially with female faculty), and social opportunities within the academic environment. That last one seems pretty obvious for anyone that has taken an engineering course, you can’t go at it alone. Yet, forming a study group, let alone making friends, becomes exponentially more challenging when no one else in the room looks like you.</p> <p>Fortunately, despite the embarrassingly low number of actual women in STEM, Hollywood has proven to stimulate progress in recent studies, like that of <a href="https://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/307"> Alegria and Branch</a>, which demonstrate, “… the importance of “exceptional” popular science fiction characters, particularly Star Trek’s Lieutenant Uhura (a black female communications officer), for underrepresented minorities in STEM fields… [T]hese characters, despite their small numbers, were inspirational to her interviewees.”</p> <p>Although the current state of STEM in academia and industry is less than ideal, it is clear that through strategic initiatives (and maybe a little dramatic encouragement), we can significantly improve the climate of STEM for historically underrepresented groups. As women in these areas of academia and industry, while we advocate for the systemic changes, we can also improve the state of our fields in the present by sticking together in groups like Society of Women Engineers and all the other national Women in [insert industry here] organizations (my favorite, of course, being Women in Nuclear). After all, as said by the late U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, <em>“There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”</em></p> <h4 id="sources">Sources</h4> <ul> <li>Alegria, S.N. and Branch, E.H. “Causes and Consequences of Inequality in the STEM: Diversity and its Discontents.” International Journal of Gender, Science and Technology, 2015.</li> <li>Francis, Aaron. “Publishing your work increases your luck.” The ReadME Project.</li> <li>Palid, Olivia; Cashdollar, Sarah; Deangelo, Sarah; Chu, Chu; Bates, Meg. “Inclusion in practice: a systematic review of diversity-focused STEM programming in the United States.” International Journal of STEM Education, January 2023.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="STEM"/><category term="nuclear,"/><category term="diversity,"/><category term="women"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[how to diversify historically homogeneous fields]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nuclear needs a makeover</title><link href="https://npanczyk.github.io/blog/2023/nuclear-makeover/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nuclear needs a makeover"/><published>2023-11-07T11:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-07T11:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://npanczyk.github.io/blog/2023/nuclear-makeover</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://npanczyk.github.io/blog/2023/nuclear-makeover/"><![CDATA[<p>No one expects computer engineers to have to advocate for their line of work. The same goes for mechanical, civil, electrical, materials– the list goes on. Society generally sees value in making faster computer chips, automating laborious processes, and designing structurally sound bridges. These are some (of many) applications to the aforementioned fields, and most demand for these industries is driven by consumers.</p> <p>Nuclear engineers, on the other hand, not only operate as the brains behind some of the most complicated physical systems known to man, they are also responsible for creating demand for their designs through <em>public outreach</em>. While, of course there will always be a demand for electrons, consumers would often prefer if these electrons came from wind, solar, hydropower, or maybe even natural gas. Few individuals would react positively to the notion of a nuclear power plant being the closest electricity generation technology to their home, yet this is exactly what the nuclear industry must advocate for. This advocacy comes in the form of a grassroots movement of scientists and energy experts working on a person-to-person basis of “debunking nuclear myths.” And therein lies the problem.</p> <p>“Debunking” implies the existence of an incorrect preconception. This is the uphill battle the nuclear industry must face today as a result of decades of bad press through the atrocities of the nuclear weapons program and global nuclear accidents.</p> <p>To clarify, the nuclear advocacy in question strictly regards nuclear energy generation, not nuclear weapons. <em>Ironically and ethically questionable as it may be, there’s already plenty of demand for that line of work…</em></p> <p>Because we know the nuclear industry is working against the perceptions of general society, we need to reframe how people think about nuclear, not just inform them about it. Think about it like boiling ice water versus tepid water– both can be boiled, but one requires significantly more energy to get there. This energy must come in the form of rebranding: nuclear needs a makeover.</p> <p>Professor Steve Cohen from the Columbia Climate School <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/31/environmental-sustainability-as-a-business-opportunity-and-risk/">writes</a>, “…in the long run, products that pollute will be more expensive than those that do not.” This is the kind of investment that the public must recognize they are making with nuclear– an investment into the clean energy future. Fast Company recently asked Jones Knowles Ritchie, an independent creative agency, to come up with a new look for nuclear. The <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90951504/jones-knowles-ritchie-rebrands-nuclear-power">branding</a> featured “forward-focused” images, like electric vehicles and spacecraft to help establish nuclear energy as a source of the future, not just of the past. It also employed a double “o” to represent the splitting of atoms during nuclear fission, a nod to the physics of the industry.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/nuc_brand-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/nuc_brand-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/nuc_brand-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/nuc_brand.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em> Image courtesy of Jones Knowles Ritchie via www.fastcompany.com.</em></p> <p>Unfortunately, rebranding nuclear energy is going to take a lot more than one clever billboard. Still, one of the most challenging parts of implementing nuclear, and therefore the largest barrier to reaping the benefits of its plentiful, carbon-free electrons, is getting the public on board. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/astro_teller_the_unexpected_benefit_of_celebrating_failure/transcript">Astro Teller remarks</a> on TED, “The only way to get people to work on big, risky things – audacious ideas – and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first, is if you make that the path of least resistance for them.” Before we can truly start implementing new nuclear technologies and powering our future with clean energy, we must overcome our biggest hurdle of public perception. That doesn’t mean laying low and letting nuclear fly under the radar; this would yield a path of resistance. It also doesn’t mean spewing technical information about reactors into people’s ears (tempting as it may be, this is almost never effective). Instead, making a path of least resistance means getting in front of the public with nuclear’s big, bold, fresh, new look and letting individuals decide on their own terms.</p> <h4 id="sources">Sources</h4> <ul> <li>Cohen, Steve. “Environmental Sustainability as a Business Opportunity and Risk.” State of the Planet, Columbia Climate School, May 2022.</li> <li>Salazar, David. “Nuclear power could be the cornerstone of a clean-energy future—but it needs better branding.” Fast Company, October 2023.</li> <li>Teller, Astro. “The unexpected benefit of celebrating failure.” TED, February 2016.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="nuclear-outreach"/><category term="nuclear,"/><category term="outreach,"/><category term="branding"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[why we must rebrand a stigmatized industry]]></summary></entry></feed>
