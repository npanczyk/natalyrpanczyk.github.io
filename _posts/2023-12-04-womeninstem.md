From a very young age, I knew I loved math. I was fortunate to attend a high school with a wide range of advanced coursework, especially in STEM. Each year of high school, I observed the number of women in my math and science classes decrease. That trend only worsened in college. The feeling of isolation of a woman in STEM is one that can only be understood from experience. 

In his article titled, “Publishing our work increases your luck,” <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work">Aaron Francis writes</a> , “No matter how hard you work, it still takes a little bit of luck for something to hit. That can be discouraging, since luck feels like a force outside our control. But the good news is that we can increase our chances of encountering good luck.”

While this may be true on an individual basis for many people, for others, it will take a greater systemic effort to increase our “luck” of female success in STEM, particularly in “hard science” fields, like CS or engineering. The premise of Francis’ article is that sharing your work is critical to building up your own success. While this hurdle can be difficult for the brave, it is debilitating for the companionless. 

More women in STEM beget more women in STEM. Diversity is critical to the success of our technical fields, yet learning how to start this positively reinforcing cycle has proven challenging on a global scale. What we do know is that promoting diversity in higher education systems is paramount to promoting it in the STEM workplace. Still, college campuses have timelessly proven themselves to alienate historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

<a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-022-00387-3">Palid et al. explain</a>, “The ‘chilly climate’ theory was coined almost 40 years ago… According to this theory, many students in STEM may experience discrimination in almost every aspect of college life, from interactions with faculty to administrators, due to a ‘chilly’ culture which tacitly allows discrimination and hostility towards students.”

Retraining higher education to “warm up” to minorities in STEM has been an all but swift task. Studies like Palid et al. 's seek to evaluate types of STEM intervention programs (SIPs) that can specifically promote the number of women retained in these majors and in their respective industries post-graduation. The most popular parameters studied are mentorship, skillbuilding, supplemental learning, financial aid, and socializing, each playing a role in female success in a given program (Palid et al.). Consequently, initiatives that encompass many of these parameters have a higher potential for impact than any one alone. 

In other words, increasing gender diversity in STEM cannot be achieved simply by offering more scholarships to women. The scholarships must be offered in tandem with research opportunities or other supplemental learning experiences, mentorship programs (especially with female faculty), and social opportunities within the academic environment. That last one seems pretty obvious for anyone that has taken an engineering course, you can’t go at it alone. Yet, forming a study group, let alone making friends, becomes exponentially more challenging when no one else in the room looks like you. 

Fortunately, despite the embarrassingly low number of actual women in STEM, Hollywood has proven to stimulate progress in recent studies, like that of <a href="https://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/307"> Alegria and Branch</a>, which demonstrate, “... the importance of “exceptional” popular science fiction characters, particularly Star Trek’s Lieutenant Uhura (a black female communications officer), for underrepresented minorities in STEM fields… [T]hese characters, despite their small numbers, were inspirational to her interviewees.”

Although the current state of STEM in academia and industry is less than ideal, it is clear that through strategic initiatives (and maybe a little dramatic encouragement), we can significantly improve the climate of STEM for historically underrepresented groups. As women in these areas of academia and industry, while we advocate for the systemic changes, we can also improve the state of our fields in the present by sticking together in groups like Society of Women Engineers and all the other national Women in [insert industry here] organizations (my favorite, of course, being Women in Nuclear). After all, as said by the late U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, <em>“There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”</em>
