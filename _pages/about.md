Nataly Panczyk is a senior majoring in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). She has a minor in Political Science and is an avid supporter of nuclear power and public outreach for clean energy systems. She currently serves as a Co-President of the Women in Nuclear chapter at UIUC and is an active member in the [UIUC American Nuclear Society chapter](https://ansatuiuc.web.engr.illinois.edu). Her research on campus is under Professor Caleb Brooks and focuses on post-critical heat flux analysis for downwards flow boiling systems. Most recently, Nataly interned with MPR, an engineering consulting company in Alexandria, VA, where she worked on safety analyses for advanced nuclear reactors, dosage modeling for fusion systems, and business and market analysis for microreactors on a nationwide scale. Previously, sheâ€™s worked for both Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on nuclear waste management modeling and Idaho National Laboratory to perform a techno economic analysis of nuclear-powered steel manufacturing. This year was her second time on the [Nuclear Engineering Student Delegation](https://nesd.org), and she is excited to continue to advocate for the technology that she believes will be critical to a global climate change solution.
